# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

### Personal notes
Instead of using erb as the view template, I decided to work with haml. A basic look at haml can be found [here.](http://erinnachen.github.io/blog/2016/02/15/Converting-an-erb-view-into-haml) To make haml a view that Rails can use, include `gem 'haml-rails'` in your `Gemfile`.
